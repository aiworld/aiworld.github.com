Bits - getting down to details
==============================

Player's machine running Unity game
                 |
                 |(multiplayer stream)
                 |
                 |-> Brain machine with the same game and different cameras
                     Cameras get screen captured and sent to brain process.
                     Brain process just takes a h.264 stream and sends back some actions,
                       so it can be written in any language, YAY!!!
