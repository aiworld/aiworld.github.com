The Game Plan
-------------

The project will consist of three bytes.

Byte 1:
Build the platform
- Hook the eyes up to Unity cameras
- Screen record the cameras
- Compress the stream by narrowing the resolution around the focal point
- Send audio from the game into an h.264 stream along with the video
- Hook the AI body up to the brain outputs
  - Joint angle changes (speed, amount)
- Create 3D test environment within Unity
- Entire environment should be runnable by a developer on one machine with a single download.
- Bifuracated architecture will encourage larger brains running on beefy hardware.
- An example brain that responds to sound and bright lights should be built.

Byte 2:
Build the brain
- Leave this to researchers who know what they're doing.

Byte 3:
Build the game
- Sufficiently advanced ais will draw game developers.
- Leave the rest to the experts.
