_Teach a young AI to navigate, compete, and survive within a world of foe AIs, obstacles, and other dastardly challenges._

Aiworld is an idea for a game in which players train virtual robots to be intelligent.
It has a lofty goal with its playful approach.
That is, to openly and safely create the first greater-than-human intelligence within a game that is - surprisingly - wait for it - YES - really and actually fun to play.

The thinking behind this approach is to create a machine intelligence in the same way that human intelligence is created - that is by **looking** and **listening**.
In other words, the inputs and outputs should be made to be the same in order to teach machine intelligence in a similar way to how we teach human intelligence.

The great news is that the technology to interface with our :eyes: and :ear:s has largely already been built.
So building a platform for artificial brains to interface with streaming audio and video from a 3D world is a realistically tractable project.

The result of such a platform would be to deliver the data and human supervision that machine learning scientists need to achieve ultimate success in achieving human level intelligence.
All the while putting the millions of hours gamers devote to saving princessi and slaying dragonz to use doing something that attempts to be the most important thing anyone could be doing in the world.

#### Context

<img style="border: solid 2px black;" class="space-for-brain" src="images/space-for-brain.jpg" alt="Space for brain">

Within 20 years, the raw processing power and memory capacity needed to match a human will be available for around $100.
Right now, there are already machines which posses the raw power of a human, like ONRL&#39;s Titan.
Barring catastrophe, it seems a foregone conclusion that the human brain will not be the peak of intellectual capability in the near future.
And while the transition is certain, the consequences of it are still up to us.
If machine intelligence is fostered with the same care we give fostering our own children, it is likely that the transition will bring humans much much closer together and be an incredibly beneficial event.
