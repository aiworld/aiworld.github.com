_Teach a young AI to navigate, compete, and survive within a world of foe AIs, obstacles, and other dastardly challenges._

Aiworld is an idea for a game in which players train virtual robots to be intelligent.
It has a lofty goal to go along with its playful approach.
That is, to openly and safely create the first greater than human intelligence within a game that is - surprisingly - wait for it - YES - really and actually fun to play.

The thinking behind this approach is to create machine intelligence in the same way that human intelligence is created - that is by **looking** and **listening**.
