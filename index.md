aiworld
====================

_Teach a young AI to navigate, compete, and survive within a world of foe AIs, obstacles, and other dastardly challenges._

Aiworld is an idea for a game in which players train virtual robots to be intelligent.
It has a lofty goal to go along with its playful approach.
That is, to openly and safely create the first greater than human intelligence within a game that is - surprisingly - wait for it - YES - really and actually fun to play.

The thinking behind this is to create machine intelligence in the same way that human intelligence is created - that is by **looking** and **listening**.
In other words, the inputs and outputs should be made the same.
The great news is that the technology to interface with our own I/O has largely already been built for video games.
So building a platform for artificial brains to interface with streaming A/V from a 3D world is a tractable project.
The result of which would bring the builders of AI algorithms together with the real data and human help, via players, that those algorithms need to achieve maximum success.
In addition, putting the millions of hours gamers devote to saving princessi and slaying dragonz to use doing something that attempts to be the most important thing that anyone could possibly be doing in the entire world.
