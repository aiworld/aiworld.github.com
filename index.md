Aiworld is an idea for a game in which players train virtual robots to be intelligent.
It has a lofty goal with a playful approach.
That is, to openly and safely create the first greater-than-human intelligence within a game that is - surprisingly - wait for it - YES - really and actually fun to play.

The idea is simple - to create a machine intelligence in the same way that human intelligence is created, that is by **looking** and **listening**.
In other words, to make our inputs and outputs the same so that we can teach machine intelligence the same way we teach human intelligence - by talking, showing, and letting it interact with the world around it.

The great news is that the technology to interface with our eyes and ears has already been built for computers.
What's left is to then stream that data to an artificial brain rather than our own and create a virtual world where humans can interact with artificial intelligence in the same way we interact with each other.

The result of this type of platform would be to deliver the data and human supervision that machine learning scientists need to be most effective.
All the while putting the millions of hours gamers devote to saving princessi and slaying dragonz to use doing something that attempts to be the most important thing in the world.

#### Context

<img style="border: solid 2px black;" class="space-for-brain" src="images/space-for-brain.jpg" alt="Space for brain">

Within 20 years, the raw processing power and memory capacity needed to match a human brain will be available for around $100.
Right now, there are some machines which already posses the raw power of a human brain, like ONRL&#39;s Titan.
Barring catastrophe, it seems a foregone conclusion that the human brain will cease to be the peak of intellectual capability on earth.
And while the transition is certain, the consequences of it are still largely up to us.
So what better way to relay our knowledge than to teach a machine the same way we teach our own children.
For if machine intelligence is fostered with the same care we give to fostering our own children, it is likely that the transition will bring humans much closer together and be an incredibly beneficial event for human intelligence, machine intelligence, and the universe as a whole.


Not only then will our values be intact, but we will relate to a machine intelligence and it will also be able to relate to us.

#### Eyes

_A project to capture a video stream that&#39;s roughly equivalent to a human&#39;s._


    960px       |  960px
    =---=       |  =---=
    | . | 960px |  | . | 960px
    =---=       |  =---=


Phase one - Open source screen record on Mac.

  Capture a 960px by 960px region at 60fps and stream in into a file or standard out via h.264.

  Should be runnable via command line

      screen-record --platform=mac --fps=60 --width=960 --height=960 --out=[stdout|file.mp4]

  Pixels are scaled pixels in this sense, not retina pixels.

  Works on Mountain Lion.
